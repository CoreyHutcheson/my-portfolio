# TODO

- [x] Menu should be above the hero.

  - [x] Position Navbar above Landing Page
  - [x] Fix all Scroll buttons to scroll to correct position

- [ ] Needs a logo in the top left… Even it’s a lightning bolt or something generic.

- [ ] I like the skills and hobbies but I don’t think it should be in a tab interface.

- [ ] Lets talk about drop shadows, You’re entire website is flat (flat design) adding drop shadows to it makes it stick out like a sore thumb.

- [x] The text under the icons need a bit more breathing room. https://www.dropbox.com/s/eqvvexv8fe2i6go/Screenshot%202019-06-12%2009.40.41.png?dl=0

- [ ] I’m digging this color: #3E637F, but the palette all together looks more elementary school and less playful.

- [ ] The dark/light mode shit is fucking genius! But you get FOUC when it changes. Most likely that is due to JS getting rerendered. Maybe make your light and dark theme regular css and toggle them with the component instead.

- [x] Wordpress = WordPress, Php = PHP, Jsx = JSX

- [ ] And more space between projects, they a little close. Also maybe put a border on them (could go either way)

- [ ] Not sure about having them open a modal with a slider.

- [ ] Modal ‘X’ should be top right.

- [ ] Also tell a story. That’s what sells. "A local business came to me with building a small but fast website. After consideration we decided to build a fast loading, React site that blah blah blah. Since the new Site launched mobile traffic has improved by 15%”

- [ ] "Message me. I'm lonely =(“ = "Let’s Talk” or “How Can I Help?”

- [ ] INCLUDE YOUR FUCKING EMAIL

- [ ] Drop Facebook. You don’t want a potential employer to know all ya business before you talk. They’ll probably stalk you anyway… Don’t make it easy.

- [ ] Also modal looks like shit on mobile.

- [ ] When clicking a link, maybe slide transition to the content. gives it a more SPA feel.

- [ ] Rethink your font choices.
  - [x] Rubik for headings
    - Landing Page
    - Section Titles
  - [x] Karla for everything else
  - [ ] Font weights
  - [ ] No opacity
