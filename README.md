# TODO

- [ ] I like the skills and hobbies but I don’t think it should be in a tab interface.

- [ ] I’m digging this color: #3E637F, but the palette all together looks more elementary school and less playful.

- [ ] The dark/light mode shit is fucking genius! But you get FOUC when it changes. Most likely that is due to JS getting rerendered. Maybe make your light and dark theme regular css and toggle them with the component instead.

- [ ] Not sure about having them open a modal with a slider.

- [ ] Also tell a story. That’s what sells. "A local business came to me with building a small but fast website. After consideration we decided to build a fast loading, React site that blah blah blah. Since the new Site launched mobile traffic has improved by 15%”

- [ ] When clicking a link, maybe slide transition to the content. gives it a more SPA feel.
